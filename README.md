# TimeSeriesForecasting-torch
This is the repository of time series forecasting models modified by xinze.zh.

Based on the work of other researchers, this repository is expected to make the codes easy-reading as well as providing more succinct, standard, easy-to-use API that can forecast time series.

## DeepAR-torch
This is a pytorch-based modification of DeepAR ([DeepAR: Probabilistic Forecasting with Autoregressive Recurrent Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04110)).

Based on the works of [TimeSeries](https://github.com/zhykoties/TimeSeries), this implementation is developed to provide more easy-reading API for training and testing single variable as well as multi-variable time sries.

## ConvRNN
This is a pytorch-based modification of [ConvRNN](https://github.com/KurochkinAlexey/ConvRNN) (Autoregressive Convolutional Recurrent Neural
Network for Univariate and Multivariate Time)

## MSVR
This is a numpy-based Multiple-output support vector regression which implements support vector regression with multi-input and multi-output. This package is based on our group's paper [Multi-step-ahead time series prediction using multiple-output support vector regression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S092523121300917X).
The details of usage can be found in [MSVR](https://github.com/Analytics-for-Forecasting/msvr).
